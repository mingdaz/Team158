### Andrew

You might want to look into how you want to serve your miscellaneous media (videos, articles, audio) as it's possible a lot this won't be hosted on your site. If it is hosted on your site, you'd have to work a little harder to achieve a similar level of functionality as you would for just linking/embedding media. Looking into websockets might also be useful for implementing real time chat. Additionally, your site will be sort of focused on seeding content to your site with the appropriate lessons and whatnot, so try to create lesson before hand to see how exactly you'd like them to be represented on the site. It might also be worth looking at Duolingo as reference for how a good language learning tool would look like.

### Shuai

Your project idea is fun and practical. However, upon looking through your proposed features, the workload is clearly too small for a team of four. I strongly recommend that you further define which additional features you will include in your project implementation, and obtain feedback from the course staff---especially Charlie---on the size and scope of your project before starting your implementation.

### Brian

Delivering different types of media over HTTP (video, audio, chinese characters) will give experience with content types. You could also use javascript to capture and upload audio from the device's microphone to test speaking skills.  Look into [getUserMedia()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia).  I like the idea of earning points and leveling up for correct answers.  For extra features to increase scope, look at duolingo.com.  They have a similar achievement system.
